Simple Discord moderation bot using Node.js

# ‚Åâ How to install
I think it couldn't be simpler.... Really not. All you need to do is download this project and preferably create a 24/7 accessible server (or host it on your PC). Once you have downloaded the files, run the command "npm install discord.js". Once the installation is complete, you can start the bot by typing the command "node bot.js".
